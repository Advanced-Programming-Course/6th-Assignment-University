/**
 * after completing the Student and Professor classes, create an instance of each one,
 * <br><br>
 * 6.using instanceof keyword, check if the instances that you have created are really an instance of human class
 * <br><br>
 * 7.write the following code: Human human = new Student();
 * <br>
 * what is the output of human.sayMyName() ?
 * <br><br>
 * 8.now write this:
 * <br>
 * Human human = new Professor();
 * <br>
 * what is the output of human.sayMyName() ?
 * <br><br>
 * what can we understand from question 7 and 8?
 * <br><br>
 * 9. in question 7, we could have declared the human variable like this:
 * <br>
 * Student human = new Student();
 * <br>
 * if you call the sayMyName() method on human variable, you can see that the output is identical to
 * <br>
 * question number 7, do you think there is a use case where we might need to declare the human variable
 * like question number 7?
 * <br>
 * (hint : try to make a list of humans that has both Students and Professors in it!)
