// After completing the Student and Professor classes, create an instance of each one:
//  6. Using instanceof keyword, check if the instances that you have created are really an instance of human class
//  7. Write the following code: Human human = new Student(); What is the output of human.sayMyName() ?
//  8. Now write this:
//  Human human = new Professor();
//  What is the output of human.sayMyName() ?
//  What can we understand from question 7 and 8?
//  9. In question 7, we could have declared the human variable like this:
//  Student human = new Student();
//  If you call the sayMyName() method on human variable, you can see that the output is identical to question number 7, do you think there is a use case where we might need to declare the human variable
//  like question number 7?
//  (HINT : try to make a list of humans that has both Students and Professors in it!)
